# Steps to Create an IAM User for AWS Access

## 1. Sign In as the Root User

Log in to the AWS Management Console using your root account credentials.

## 2. Navigate to the IAM Service

Go to the IAM Console: [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).  
Click on **Users** in the left-hand menu.

## 3. Create a New IAM User

Click **Add Users**.  
Enter a username (e.g., `cdk-user`).  
Select **Access key - Programmatic access** as the AWS credential type.  
Click **Next: Permissions**.

## 4. Attach Permissions to the User

You can attach permissions to the user in one of the following ways:

### Option 1: Attach Administrator Access (Simplest for Setup)

Select the checkbox for the policy **AdministratorAccess**.  
This grants full permissions to the user.

### Option 2: Grant Least Privilege (Recommended for Security)

Create a custom policy with the required permissions for CDK, EFS, and Lambda. Example policy:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudformation:*",
                "lambda:*",
                "elasticfilesystem:*",
                "iam:*",
                "ec2:*",
                "s3:*",
                "sts:*",
                "ecr:*",
                "ssm:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Attach this policy to the user.

## 5. Complete the Process

Review the user details and click **Create User**.  
After the user is created, you’ll see the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.  
Download the credentials file or copy the keys securely. You won’t be able to retrieve the secret key again later.

## 6. Configure AWS CLI with the IAM User

Run the `aws configure` command and provide the newly created user's Access Key ID and Secret Access Key:

```bash
aws configure
```

Enter the following:

- **Access Key ID**: The key from the IAM user.
- **Secret Access Key**: The secret key from the IAM user.
- **Default region name**: e.g., `us-east-2`.
- **Default output format**: e.g., `json`.

## 7. Use the New User for CDK

Once configured, you can run CDK commands such as `cdk deploy` and `cdk bootstrap` using the new IAM user’s credentials.
